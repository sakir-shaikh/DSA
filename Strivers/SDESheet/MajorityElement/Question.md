## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return the majority element.  
The majority element is the element that appears more than `âŒŠn / 2âŒ‹` times.  
You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

## âœ… Approach

Used **Mooreâ€™s Voting Algorithm**:

1. Initialize `element` as a candidate for majority and `count` as 0.
2. Traverse the array:
   - If `count` is 0, set `element` to current number.
   - If current number equals `element`, increment `count`.
   - Else, decrement `count`.
3. Return `element` as the majority.

**Complexity:** `O(n)` time for single pass, `O(1)` space.
