## Topics Covered

1. Arrays & Matrix
2. Binary Search
3. Binary Trees
4. Linked Lists
5. Stack
6. Strings
7. [More topics to be added]

## Structure

Each topic has its own directory containing:

- README.md: Topic overview and patterns
- Problem directories: Each with
  - Question.md: Problem statement and approach
  - Solution.java: Implementation with comments
