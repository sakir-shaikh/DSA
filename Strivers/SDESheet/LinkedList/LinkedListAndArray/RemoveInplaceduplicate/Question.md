# Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

## Problem Statement

Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and return the new length.

## Example

Input: [1,1,2]

## Approach

- Use two pointers to overwrite duplicates.

## Edge Cases

- Array is empty.
- Array has all duplicates.
- Array has no duplicates.

## Complexity

- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)

## Implementation Notes

- In-place removal using two pointers.
