# Binary Search

## Overview

Binary Search is a fundamental algorithm for searching a sorted array in O(log n) time. It is widely used in real-life applications (search engines, databases, interview questions).

## Real-life Use Cases

- Finding an element in a sorted list
- Lower/upper bound problems
- Search in rotated sorted array
- Efficient search in large datasets

## Interview Relevance

Binary Search is a must-know for technical interviews. Variants are frequently asked (first/last occurrence, search in 2D matrix, etc.).
