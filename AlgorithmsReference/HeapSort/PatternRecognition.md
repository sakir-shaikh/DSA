# Pattern Recognition: When to Use Heap Sort

## How to Recognize Heap Sort Problems

- The problem requires sorting efficiently (O(n log n))
- You need in-place sorting
- You need to repeatedly access the largest/smallest element
- Heap data structure is mentioned

## Common Patterns

- **Sort an array efficiently in-place**
- **Find the kth largest/smallest element using a heap**
- **Problems involving priority queues**

## Typical Question Keywords

- "Sort"
- "Heap"
- "Priority queue"
- "Kth largest/smallest"
- "O(n log n)"

## Example Interview Prompts

- "Sort an array using a heap."
- "Find the kth largest element using a heap."
- "Implement a priority queue."

## How to Get the 'Click'

- If the problem involves a heap or priority queue, think Heap Sort
- If you need to repeatedly access the largest/smallest, consider Heap Sort
- If in-place sorting is required, Heap Sort may apply

**Tip:** Heap Sort is in-place and not stable. Practice heap operations to recognize when to use it!
