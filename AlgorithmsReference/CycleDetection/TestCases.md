# Cycle Detection Test Cases

## Test Case 1: Linked List

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,2] (cycle at node 2)
Expected Output: true

## Test Case 2: Directed Graph

Input: Graph = {0: [1], 1: [2], 2: [0]}
Expected Output: true

## Test Case 3: Undirected Graph

Input: Graph = {0: [1], 1: [0,2], 2: [1]}
Expected Output: false
