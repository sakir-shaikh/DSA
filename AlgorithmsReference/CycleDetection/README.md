# Cycle Detection

## Overview

Cycle detection is used to determine if a cycle exists in a graph or linked list. It is crucial for avoiding infinite loops and for many graph algorithms.

## Real-life Use Cases

- Detecting infinite loops in linked lists
- Deadlock detection in operating systems
- Checking for cycles in dependency graphs

## Interview Relevance

Cycle detection is common in interviews for graph and linked list problems.
