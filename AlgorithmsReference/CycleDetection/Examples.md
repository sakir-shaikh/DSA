# Cycle Detection Examples

## Example 1: Linked List Cycle

Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle linking node -4 to node 2.

## Example 2: Directed Graph Cycle

Input: Graph = {0: [1], 1: [2], 2: [0]}
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle 0 → 1 → 2 → 0.
