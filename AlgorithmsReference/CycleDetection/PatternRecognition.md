# Pattern Recognition: When to Use Cycle Detection

## How to Recognize Cycle Detection Problems

- The problem involves graphs or linked lists
- You need to check for infinite loops or repeated nodes
- The problem asks for deadlock or dependency resolution

## Common Patterns

- **Detect cycle in linked list**
- **Detect cycle in directed/undirected graph**
- **Deadlock detection**

## Typical Question Keywords

- "Cycle"
- "Loop"
- "Repeated"
- "Deadlock"
- "Dependency"

## Example Interview Prompts

- "Detect a cycle in a linked list."
- "Check if a directed graph has a cycle."
- "Detect deadlock in a system."

## How to Get the 'Click'

- If the problem involves repeated nodes or infinite loops, think cycle detection
- If the problem is about dependencies or deadlocks, cycle detection applies

**Tip:** Practice cycle detection on graphs and linked lists to recognize these patterns quickly!
