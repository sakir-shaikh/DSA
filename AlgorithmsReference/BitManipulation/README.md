# Bit Manipulation

## Overview

Bit manipulation is a technique for performing operations on binary numbers using bitwise operators. It is used for optimization, cryptography, and low-level programming.

## Real-life Use Cases

- Data compression
- Cryptography
- Graphics and image processing
- Optimization in competitive programming

## Interview Relevance

Bit manipulation is common in interviews for problems involving numbers, optimization, and tricky logic.
