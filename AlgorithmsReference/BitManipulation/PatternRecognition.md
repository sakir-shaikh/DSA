# Pattern Recognition: When to Use Bit Manipulation

## How to Recognize Bit Manipulation Problems

- The problem involves binary representation of numbers
- You need to optimize for speed or space
- The solution requires toggling, setting, or checking bits
- The problem involves powers of two, parity, or XOR

## Common Patterns

- **Count set bits**
- **Find single number in array (XOR)**
- **Check if a number is power of two**
- **Swap numbers without temp variable**
- **Reverse bits**

## Typical Question Keywords

- "Bitwise"
- "XOR"
- "AND/OR"
- "Set/Clear/Toggle bit"
- "Power of two"
- "Parity"

## Example Interview Prompts

- "Count the number of 1s in binary representation."
- "Find the single number in an array where every other appears twice."
- "Check if a number is a power of two."

## How to Get the 'Click'

- If the problem involves binary numbers, think bit manipulation
- If you need to optimize for space/speed, use bitwise operations
- If XOR, AND, OR are mentioned, bit manipulation applies

**Tip:** Practice bit manipulation on number and array problems to recognize these patterns quickly!
