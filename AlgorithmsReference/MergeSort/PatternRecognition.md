# Pattern Recognition: When to Use Merge Sort

## How to Recognize Merge Sort Problems

- The problem requires sorting a large dataset efficiently (O(n log n))
- You need to count inversions or solve problems related to order statistics
- The input size is too large for O(n^2) algorithms
- The problem can be divided into smaller subproblems and merged

## Common Patterns

- **Sort an array or linked list efficiently**
- **Count inversions in an array**
- **Merge two sorted arrays/lists**
- **Problems involving divide and conquer**

## Typical Question Keywords

- "Sort"
- "Merge"
- "Count inversions"
- "Efficiently"
- "O(n log n)"
- "Divide and conquer"

## Example Interview Prompts

- "Sort an array of integers."
- "Count the number of inversions in an array."
- "Merge two sorted linked lists."
- "Sort a linked list in O(n log n) time."

## How to Get the 'Click'

- If the problem asks for efficient sorting, think Merge Sort
- If you need to merge sorted data, consider Merge Sort
- If the problem can be split and solved recursively, Merge Sort may apply

**Tip:** Merge Sort is stable and works well for linked lists and external sorting. Practice recognizing these patterns to know when to use it!
