# Bellman-Ford Algorithm

## Overview

Bellman-Ford is a single-source shortest path algorithm for graphs that may have negative edge weights. It can also detect negative cycles.

## Real-life Use Cases

- Network routing protocols
- Currency arbitrage detection
- Finding shortest paths in graphs with negative weights

## Interview Relevance

Bellman-Ford is important for problems involving shortest paths with negative weights and cycle detection.
