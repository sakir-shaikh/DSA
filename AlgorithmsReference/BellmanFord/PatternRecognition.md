# Pattern Recognition: When to Use Bellman-Ford

## How to Recognize Bellman-Ford Problems

- The graph has negative edge weights
- You need to detect negative cycles
- Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm cannot be used (negative weights)

## Common Patterns

- **Single-source shortest path with negative weights**
- **Detecting negative cycles**

## Typical Question Keywords

- "Negative weights"
- "Shortest path"
- "Negative cycle"
- "Relaxation"

## Example Interview Prompts

- "Find shortest paths in a graph with negative weights."
- "Detect if a graph contains a negative cycle."

## How to Get the 'Click'

- If the graph has negative weights, think Bellman-Ford
- If you need to detect negative cycles, use Bellman-Ford

**Tip:** Practice Bellman-Ford on graphs with negative weights and cycle detection!
