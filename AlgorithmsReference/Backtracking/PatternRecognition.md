# Pattern Recognition: When to Use Backtracking

## How to Recognize Backtracking Problems

- The problem asks for all possible solutions (permutations, combinations, subsets)
- The problem involves constraints that must be satisfied
- The solution space is exponential
- The problem can be solved recursively by exploring all options

## Common Patterns

- **Generate all permutations/combinations/subsets**
- **Solve puzzles (Sudoku, N-Queens, Crossword)**
- **Find all paths in a maze**
- **Constraint satisfaction problems**

## Typical Question Keywords

- "Find all"
- "Generate"
- "Permutations"
- "Combinations"
- "Subsets"
- "Recursion"
- "Backtrack"

## Example Interview Prompts

- "Generate all permutations of a string."
- "Solve the N-Queens problem."
- "Find all subsets of a set."
- "Solve Sudoku."

## How to Get the 'Click'

- If the problem asks for all possible solutions, think backtracking
- If constraints must be checked at each step, use backtracking
- If recursion and undoing choices are needed, backtracking applies

**Tip:** Practice backtracking on combinatorial and constraint problems to recognize these patterns quickly!
