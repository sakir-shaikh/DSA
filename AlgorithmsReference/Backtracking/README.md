# Backtracking

## Overview

Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, removing solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point in time.

## Real-life Use Cases

- Solving puzzles (Sudoku, N-Queens)
- Generating permutations and combinations
- Pathfinding in mazes
- Constraint satisfaction problems

## Interview Relevance

Backtracking is frequently asked in interviews for problems involving recursion, combinatorics, and constraint satisfaction.
