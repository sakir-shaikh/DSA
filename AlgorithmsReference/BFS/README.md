# Breadth-First Search (BFS)

## Overview

BFS is a fundamental graph traversal algorithm that explores nodes level by level. It is used in shortest path problems, connectivity, and many interview questions.

## Real-life Use Cases

- Finding shortest path in unweighted graphs
- Web crawling
- Social network analysis
- Network broadcasting

## Interview Relevance

BFS is frequently asked in interviews for problems involving graphs, trees, and grids.
