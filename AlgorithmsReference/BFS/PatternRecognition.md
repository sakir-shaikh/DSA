# Pattern Recognition: When to Use BFS

## How to Recognize BFS Problems

- The problem involves finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph
- You need to explore all nodes level by level
- The problem is about connectivity or reachability
- The input is a graph, tree, or grid

## Common Patterns

- **Shortest path in unweighted graph**
- **Level order traversal of a tree**
- **Flood fill in a grid**
- **Finding connected components**

## Typical Question Keywords

- "Shortest path"
- "Level order"
- "Breadth-first"
- "Unweighted graph"
- "Connectivity"

## Example Interview Prompts

- "Find the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph."
- "Perform level order traversal of a binary tree."
- "Flood fill a grid."

## How to Get the 'Click'

- If the problem asks for shortest path in an unweighted graph, think BFS
- If you need to process nodes level by level, use BFS
- If the problem involves reachability or connectivity, BFS may apply

**Tip:** Practice BFS on graphs, trees, and grids to recognize these patterns quickly!
