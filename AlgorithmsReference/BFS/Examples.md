# BFS Examples

## Example 1: Shortest Path in Unweighted Graph

Input: Graph = {0: [1,2], 1: [0,3], 2: [0,3], 3: [1,2]}, start = 0
Output: [0, 1, 2, 3]
Explanation: BFS visits nodes in order of increasing distance from start.

## Example 2: Level Order Traversal of Binary Tree

Input: Tree = [1,2,3,null,4]
Output: [[1], [2,3], [4]]
Explanation: BFS visits nodes level by level.
